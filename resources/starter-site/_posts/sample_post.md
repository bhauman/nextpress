## What is it?

It's a frameless geodesic dome designed to be easy to fabricate and build.

It is 18 feet wide at the widest point and about 13 feet tall. It
feels very spacious for it's 209 square foot floor.

The dome shell is built out of 3/16" corrugated plastic and 3/4"
blueboard foam insulation. The shell of the dome is a basically a foam
board insulation sandwich. There is an outer plastic dome, two layers
of tightly fitted blueboard insulation and then an inner plastic dome.
It's all held together with bolts that bolt through all the layers.
The shell of the dome is about 2 1/2 inches thick.

There is no frame in this dome. The shell is self supporting much like
and igloo is self supporting.

The dome has a radial 2x4 floor system held up by cinder blocks. The
floor is also insulated with 2 layers of blueboard foam insulation.

It has electricity and is heated with a single electric radiator and
is cooled with an exhaust fan and small window sized air conditioner.

The materials are all easily attainable and it cost about $2100 to
build it at the time.

The dome shell is also extremely easy to disassemble making it
a portable structure.

## Hacking housing

If I want to spend my time writing blog posts, exploring new
programming languages, and other things that I want to do but I am
unlikely to get paid for, it's helpful to opt out of certain common
expenses.  Housing is a major expense that is ripe for pruning.

Conventional housing requires that we spend a tremendous amount of
energy and money to construct and maintain a home.
